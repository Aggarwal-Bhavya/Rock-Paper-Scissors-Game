# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
This Python code is based on the traditional two person game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. <br />
Here, the user is provided with an opportunity to either play against the CPU or play in Multiplayer (2-Player) mode. <br /> <br />
If and when, the user chooses to play against the CPU, the user gets the first chance to pick option amongst the three. 
After that the CPU chooses its option using the randint() inbuilt option. 
<br /> 
On the other hand, in 2 Player mode, each player is presented by the opportunity to take turns while playing an option.
<br /> <br />
The Python code for this game can be viewed here.
